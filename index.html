            <h1>Let’s Bloom in Harmony!!</h1>
            <p>This garden was founded by W.O.Bren in 2005 after developing his long lived passion 
                and love for nature. He lived the better part of his life in his green homestead 
                surrounded by different varieties of plants with colorful and beautiful flowers.
                 Bees’ second home was in his garden as they got their harvest from nectars from
                  the beauty of nature.</p>
